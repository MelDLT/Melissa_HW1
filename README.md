# Qapital
## Overview and Origin


Qapital started in 2013, Founded by George Friedman and Katherine Salisbury. The George and Katherine wanted to find a way to save money effortlessly. So they they created a personal finance app to manage their personal saving goals through their spending habits. Qapital charges monthly fees to their consumers with different subscriptions to what the consumer is looking for. Since they've started Qapital they have funded [$47.3 m](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qapital#section-overview). 


## Business Activities:

 The company is trying to solve the ease of saving money. Where they can use technology to set money aside by habits, purchases, or by something random such as a rainy day. They are insured by the FDIC and it also has checking and savings feature.

 The consumer can set different rules that will trigger an amount to be transfered from the consumer's bank to the qapital savings app. The consumer still has access to the money whenever it is needed. Since the company was created for an app usage that is their main source. They have also paired with ITFF where that company can use other technology such as turning on a light switch will result of money being transfered to the app. that is how the consumer will save money. Qapital has about 42,000 users that have saved $500 million through the app. According the author, ["But Qapital is more than just a Digit -style savings tool these days. The company has also folded in Qapital Spending through a linked Visa Debit Card that works with money saved through the app — as well as a budgeting tool called Qapital Weekly Spending Target."](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/mobile-money-saving-app-qapital-raises-30-million-to-spend-on-growth/) 




## Landscape:


 Qapital is in the Personal Finance, Deposits, and Online Banking domain. It is essentially an automatic savings app. Other companies in this domain is called Digit, Chime, Acorn ect. These other companies essentially provide the same things as Qapital. The personal finance industry has changed immensly since from the past 10 years. Most banks are mobile friendly also it is a must for consumers to have an app. The transfering of money from a savings account to checking happens in seconds. Depositing checks through the phone, paying a friend back with out cash has become so easy for the consumer. The banking industry has revovled around how to make banking easier for the average banking customer.  

## Results



 The business impact of this company was when they introduced the psychological part of saving money. ["As George Friedman,  Qapital’s chief executive and co-founder noted in an email, “banks haven’t done enough to inspire and engage customers, and … banks simply can’t match the innovation speed of start-up challengers.”](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/mobile-money-saving-app-qapital-raises-30-million-to-spend-on-growth/)
With this in mind since their target are the millennials, they designed to motivate their consumers to save money through pyschology of their spending behavior. They use the amount of users that they accumilated as well as how much they have helped save. They have a star rating of [4.2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qapital&hl=en_US) on Google play and a [4.8](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qapital-finance-save-budget/id969977669) on the App store. 
Qapital has found itself on the top of the list of one of the best savings apps compared to other competitors. With criteria such as free or very low prices, easy to use, and the ability to choose differnt goals and triggers. 



## Recommendations


The ability for others to send money to your account if they wish to gift/pay back. Also have a joint goal with another person so they can have a goal together. 
I belive the ablity to have someone to send money to your specific goal almost like a venmo, which is something this app is missing. The app can pair up with an already existing app such as venmo so transfering of money to the Qapital's saving account.
